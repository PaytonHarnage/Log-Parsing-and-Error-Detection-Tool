# Log-Parsing-and-Error-Detection-Tool
This Python tool automates the process of parsing log files to detect and report errors or warnings in system/application logs. The tool categorizes errors, highlights critical issues, and generates reports for troubleshooting.

# Features: 
* Error Detection: Detects common error patterns such as "ERROR", "WARNING", and "[CRITICAL]" in log files.
* Customizable: Easily extendable to search for additional error patterns or more complex log formats.
* Report Generation: Generates a clean, readable report summarizing the detected issues.
* Python-Based: Written in Python, making it simple to use, extend, and modify.

# Technologies Used
* Python 3.x
* Regular Expressions ('re' module)
* File Handling
* Scripting (Python)

# Getting Started 
To use the Log Parser and Error Detector: 
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Place the Python script ('log_parser.py) and a sample log file (e.g., 'sample_log.txt) in the same directory.
4. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python log_parser.py
    ```
5. The script will parse the log file and output a report of detected errors and warnings in the terminal/console.

# Example Output
When the script detects errors, it will generate an output like this:

1. ERROR: Failed to connect to database.
2. WARNING: High memory usage detected.
3. CRITICAL: Application crashed unexpectedly.
4. ERROR: Could not read configuration file.
